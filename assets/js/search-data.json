            "title": "Pitcher's Win-Loss Record Has to Go",
            "content": "by Walker Dickey . With the MLB season looming and the Astros dominating the headlines, there is something else the league must consider. It is time to let go of the pitcher’s win-loss record. It’s irrelevant, an outdated stat, and carries no real value to determine how good a pitcher actually is. There’s not just one thing that makes it a bad stat, rather a combination of rules and regulations that make it a stat that simply doesn’t matter. . The first rule that baffles me is how starting pitchers have different rules to get a win than relievers do. In order to qualify for a win, a starting pitcher must pitch at least five innings. On the other hand, relievers often only have to get one out. For example, if a starter has gone through 4 ⅔ perfect innings with a lead and has to come out of the game due to injury, he does not qualify for the win, even though he dominated over half the game. The reliever, having worked harder in the bullpen than in the live game, would most likely “earn” the win. By rule, all he would have to do is not give up two runs. If his team maintained its lead, he would be credited with the win, even if he was pulled after getting just a single out. The rule states the official scorer “generally should, but is not required to,” consider the reliever’s outing “ineffective and brief” if the reliever pitches less than one inning and allows two or more earned runs. This mess tries, but fails, to make the stat better. The starter is still cheated out of the win, and the stat is still useless. . On top of that, relievers can actually be rewarded with wins for giving up runs, which kind of defeats the purpose of the stat, but it happens frequently. In fact, I was at a game last year where the home team was leading 3-1 heading into the ninth inning. Just like any other team would do, they brought in their closer. Said closer gave up a two run home run to tie the game. His team then went on to walk off in the bottom half of the inning. As I was leaving my seat, I heard the PA announcer say that the closer was the winning pitcher. All he did while he was in the game was put his team in a worse position to win than they were in when he entered the game, but because the stat is tremendously flawed to say the least, he was rewarded with the win. . In the 2018 MLB season, Jacob Degrom and Max Scherzer were battling it out for the NL Cy Young award. However, the fact that it was even a discussion was absurd. Granted, Scherzer had an outstanding season, but Degrom’s was better, and it wasn’t particularly close. Over the course of that season, Scherzer was 18-7, gave up 62 earned runs, and had an ERA of 2.53, which again, is extraordinary. However, isn’t the main job of a pitcher to not give up runs? Well, on that measure, Degrom was much better, 32% better in fact. He gave up just 41 earned runs for an ERA of 1.70. However, his record was just 10-9. It shouldn’t have even been a discussion. It should have been Degrom’s award, no question, no debate. But his lack of wins left the award up for grabs. Degrom’s record ended up being above .500, but for much of that season, he was either at that mark or below. The whole time there was debate about whether Degrom should get the award with a record below .500, and many people said no. Obviously, Degrom won the award by a wide margin, but I am left to wonder if his record had finished at or below .500, would he still have won? Had that happened, and Scherzer won, it would have been a robbery, and the pitcher’s win-loss record the thief. . The fact is the pitcher’s win-loss record is just behind the times. It was a stat that was more suitable for a time when pitchers were throwing complete games, but that just doesn’t happen much anymore. In an MLB season, 2,430 combined games are played across all 30 teams. In the 2019 season, 45 complete games were thrown. That is only in about 1.9% of the games. It’s not a pitcher’s job to score runs for his team, but since pitchers are throwing fewer innings now, their personal records rely too much on the team around them to be an effective stat. . Now you’re probably wondering if you do away with the win-loss record for pitchers, what do you replace it with? Well, it doesn’t need replacing. It’s not needed to determine which team won the game, or to show how good a pitcher is. Plenty of other stats do a substantially better job of that. There’s more than just ERA. There’s WHIP, which measures how many people the pitcher lets on base per inning, FIP, which determines how lucky or unlucky pitchers get, ERA+, which adjusts for ballparks and opponents to determine how much better or worse the pitcher is than league average, and numerous other stats, all of which do a better job of telling a pitcher’s story than their personal record does. . The bottom line is the pitcher’s win-loss record is a stat that does not belong in today’s MLB. It is a poor stat that provides no information about how good a pitcher actually is. Worse yet, it obstructs people’s views, leading them to believe some pitchers are better than others for no good reason. It is time the MLB moves away from the pitcher’s win-loss record. It did good work while it lasted, but in today’s game, it’s irrelevant and confusing. We have much better ways to gauge the quality of a pitcher. Continuing to use the win-loss stat makes about as much sense as still using VHS tapes. Let it go people. The win-loss record no longer does the job. .",

            "title": "Introducing fastpages",
            "content": ". We are very pleased to announce the immediate availability of fastpages. fastpages is a platform which allows you to create and host a blog for free, with no ads and many useful features, such as: . Create posts containing code, outputs of code (which can be interactive), formatted text, etc directly from Jupyter Notebooks; for instance see this great example post from Scott Hawley. Notebook posts support features such as: Interactive visualizations made with Altair remain interactive. | Hide or show cell input and output. | Collapsable code cells that are either open or closed by default. | Define the Title, Summary and other metadata via a special markdown cells | Ability to add links to Colab and GitHub automatically. | . | Create posts, including formatting and images, directly from Microsoft Word documents. | Create and edit Markdown posts entirely online using GitHub&#39;s built-in markdown editor. | Embed Twitter cards and YouTube videos. | Categorization of blog posts by user-supplied tags for discoverability. | ... and much more | . fastpages relies on Github pages for hosting, and Github Actions to automate the creation of your blog. The setup takes around three minutes, and does not require any technical knowledge or expertise. Due to built-in automation of fastpages, you don&#39;t have to fuss with conversion scripts. All you have to do is save your Jupyter notebook, Word document or markdown file into a specified directory and the rest happens automatically. Infact, this blog post is written in a Jupyter notebook, which you can see with the &quot;View on GitHub&quot; link above. . fast.ai have previously released a similar project called fast_template, which is even easier to set up, but does not support automatic creation of posts from Microsoft Word or Jupyter notebooks, including many of the features outlined above. . Because fastpages is more flexible and extensible, we recommend using it where possible. fast_template may be a better option for getting folks blogging who have no technical expertise at all, and will only be creating posts using Github&#39;s integrated online editor. . Setting Up Fastpages . The setup process of fastpages is automated with GitHub Actions, too! Upon creating a repo from the fastpages template, a pull request will automatically be opened (after ~ 30 seconds) configuring your blog so it can start working. The automated pull request will greet you with instructions like this: . . All you have to do is follow these instructions (in the PR you receive) and your new blogging site will be up and running! . Jupyter Notebooks &amp; Fastpages . In this post, we will cover special features that fastpages provides has for Jupyter notebooks. You can also write your blog posts with Word documents or markdown in fastpages, which contain many, but not all the same features. . Options via FrontMatter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # Title &gt; Awesome summary - toc: true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . All of the above settings are enabled in this post, so you can see what they look like! . the summary field (preceeded by &gt;) will be displayed under your title, and will also be used by social media to display as the description of your page. | toc: setting this to true will automatically generate a table of contents | badges: setting this to true will display Google Colab and GitHub links on your blog post. | comments: setting this to true will enable comments. See these instructions for more details. | author this will display the authors names. | categories will allow your post to be categorized on a &quot;Tags&quot; page, where readers can browse your post by categories. | . Markdown front matter is formatted similarly to notebooks. The differences between the two can be viewed on the fastpages README. . Code Folding . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . If you want to completely hide cells (not just collapse them), read these instructions. . Interactive Charts With Altair . Interactive visualizations made with Altair remain interactive! . We leave this below cell unhidden so you can enjoy a preview of syntax highlighting in fastpages, which uses the Dracula theme. . # select a point for which to provide details-on-demand label = alt.selection_single( encodings=[&#39;x&#39;], # limit selection to x-axis value on=&#39;mouseover&#39;, # select on mouseover events nearest=True, # select data point nearest the cursor empty=&#39;none&#39; # empty selection includes no data points ) # define our base line chart of stock prices base = alt.Chart().mark_line().encode( alt.X(&#39;date:T&#39;), alt.Y(&#39;price:Q&#39;, scale=alt.Scale(type=&#39;log&#39;)), alt.Color(&#39;symbol:N&#39;) ) alt.layer( base, # base line chart # add a rule mark to serve as a guide line alt.Chart().mark_rule(color=&#39;#aaa&#39;).encode( x=&#39;date:T&#39; ).transform_filter(label), # add circle marks for selected time points, hide unselected points base.mark_circle().encode( opacity=alt.condition(label, alt.value(1), alt.value(0)) ).add_selection(label), # add white stroked text to provide a legible background for labels base.mark_text(align=&#39;left&#39;, dx=5, dy=-5, stroke=&#39;white&#39;, strokeWidth=2).encode( text=&#39;price:Q&#39; ).transform_filter(label), # add text labels for stock prices base.mark_text(align=&#39;left&#39;, dx=5, dy=-5).encode( text=&#39;price:Q&#39; ).transform_filter(label), data=stocks ).properties( width=700, height=400 ) . Data Tables . You can display tables per the usual way in your blog: . movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; df = pd.read_json(movies) # display table with pandas df[[&#39;Title&#39;, &#39;Worldwide_Gross&#39;, &#39;Production_Budget&#39;, &#39;IMDB_Rating&#39;]].head() .

How fastpages Converts Notebooks to Blog Posts . fastpages uses nbdev to power the conversion process of Jupyter Notebooks to blog posts. When you save a notebook into the /_notebooks folder of your repository, GitHub Actions applies nbdev against those notebooks automatically. The same process occurs when you save Word documents or markdown files into the _word or _posts directory, respectively. . We will discuss how GitHub Actions work in a follow up blog post. . Resources &amp; Next Steps . We highly encourage you to start blogging with fastpages! Some resources that may be helpful: . fastpages repo - this is where you can go to create your own fastpages blog! | Fastai forums - nbdev &amp; blogging category. You can ask questions about fastpages here, as well as suggest new features. | nbdev: this project powers the conversion of Jupyter notebooks to blog posts. | .
